## Welcome to the Xiaomi-Common

A sister project of [moto-common](https://github.com/moto-common) aimed at doing the same for Xiaomi / Redmi / POCO devices.

This organization houses common device trees and supporting repos for various Xiaomi devices and is very much work-in-progress for the forseeable future.

Currently work is being done by [@itshanibee](https://github.com/itshanibee), assisted by various people from the AOSP community. Your contributions are greatly valued and won't go unnoticed.
